From the beginning of the TriviaQuack I have clearly stated my git commit messages with breif descriptions about the topic 
and the details of code alterations.

Fat Free Framework is used to create routes and seperation of the View, Controller, and the Model.
Template's of views were generated by the Fat Free Framework.

Created prepared statements to call on function's with different variables can be passed in to work for altering user contributions.

User's are allowed to alter their data. Data gets updated as they play more and the user's can not be deleted however

Object Oriented Programming is defined between class hierarchy which uses includes a parent and to child classes that supports our user objects that plays the game. One object being the guest where they are not required to sign in. The other for registered member's which allow's multiple functionalities.

Full Docblocks are provided for PHP. Code is well commented through out the site. Seperation of the MVC helped clear coding and commenting for the project.

User input's are completely validated on client side with Javascript and server side validation is being checked by PHP.

TriviaQuack incorporates Jquery and Ajax to create functionality on the client side. Ajax functions are also used with Json requests for the API utilization. 

API Utilization takes place in TriviaQuack where player's are able to choose from 8 different game category options or they are allowed to choose a random question which againis generated by the API.
URL: https://opentdb.com/api.php | Parameters of the API are retrieved from user.
